/* Variables = Variables are selected named items in Javascript
that can be given important information that can be used later.
For instance, you can say that a variable named "x" = 4, when you 
want to know what x is later, it will be 4. There are three kinds 
of variables, there is the old way, which is var. The second is 
called let, which you can change its information later if you want.
The last kind is called const, which stands for constant. Once you
give a constant an important piece of information, you cannot change
it later.

Strings = Strings represent text. Consider a birthday party, and a
banner with strings of letters pieced together spelling Happy Birthday!

Functions = Functions are like machines. This is how they work. You put
something in them, like a piece of flat glass, and then the machine
shapes them into a beautiful vase at the end. The function machine takes
something you give it, called an argument, it does something special
 with it. Then, it gives you that special something, which is called
 a return.

 If statements = If statements put a condition for a particular machine.
 For instance, if a number is bigger than 0, than it will turn the number
 green. If, however, the number is 0 or less, it will do something else.
 Turn red if it is below 0, for instance...If it is 0, than the text
 can stay black, if you give it a condition.

 Boolean values = Boolean values determine if something is true or false.
 1 = (-1), would have a Boolean value of false.
 Plants use photosynthesis, would have a Boolean value of true. */
